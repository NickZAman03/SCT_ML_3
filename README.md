# Synthetic Cat vs Dog Image Classification with SVM
**Project Overview**
This project implements an image classification model using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify synthetic images of cats and dogs. The images are randomly generated as noise and then flattened for classification. The SVM classifier is trained on these synthetic features to predict whether the image represents a cat or a dog.

**Features**
* Synthetic Data Generation: The images are randomly generated as 64x64 pixel arrays (grayscale) and labeled as either "cat" or "dog."
* SVM Model: The Support Vector Machine is used as the classifier with a linear kernel. It can be experimented with using other kernels like 'rbf' or 'poly'.
* Model Evaluation: The model is evaluated based on accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
* Visualization: Random sample predictions are visualized alongside their true labels to evaluate the performance of the model.
**Prerequisites**
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

* numpy - For data manipulation.
* scikit-learn - For building the machine learning model.
* matplotlib - For visualizing images and results.
* seaborn - For visualizing the confusion matrix.
You can install these using pip:

`bash
Copy code
pip install numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn`

**Usage**
1. Generating Synthetic Data
The dataset is generated randomly using NumPy, where:

num_samples = 1000 (number of images per class).
img_size = (64, 64) (image resolution).
Each image is assigned a label:

0 for "cat"
1 for "dog"
2. Training the SVM Classifier
The SVM model is trained with the synthetic data. The code uses a linear kernel by default, but you can switch to other kernels ('rbf', 'poly') for experimentation.

3. Model Evaluation
After training the model:

The accuracy is printed.
A classification report (precision, recall, F1-score) is displayed.
A confusion matrix is shown to visualize misclassifications.
A random subset of images is displayed alongside their predicted and true labels for visual validation.
4. Running the Code
To run the code:

`bash
Copy code
python synthetic_data_svm.py`
5. Visualization
The script will also display the confusion matrix and some sample predictions with their true labels for visual inspection of the model's performance.

**Example Output**
Here’s what you can expect:

* Accuracy: A printout of the model's accuracy on the test data.
* Classification Report: A detailed breakdown of precision, recall, and F1 scores for both classes (cats and dogs).
* Confusion Matrix: A heatmap showing the number of correct and incorrect predictions.
* Predictions Visualization: Sample images with true and predicted labels.
**Future Improvements**
* Data Augmentation: For a more realistic dataset, you could apply transformations like rotation, zoom, etc.
* Feature Engineering: Instead of using random noise, feature extraction techniques such as HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) could be applied.
* Hyperparameter Tuning: You could try tuning the SVM’s hyperparameters, such as the C parameter, to improve performance.
